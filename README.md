**`Digital Craftman`**

**Hey there,** 

I'm Samuele, a `Junior Front-End Developer` passionate about creating extraordinary user experience. I'm a student at the `University of Catania` and I'm pursuing my academic path in `CyberSecurity`. I love to actively collaborate with my **colleagues** and contribute to **open-source projects** to broaden my skills and **share my knowledge with the entire world**. I like to think that every problem can be solved with an algorithm and a snippet code.
